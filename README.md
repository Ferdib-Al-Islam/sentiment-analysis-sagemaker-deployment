# sentiment-analysis-sagemaker-deployment
Welcome to the SageMaker deployment project! In this project we will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. we will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, we will deploy our model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
